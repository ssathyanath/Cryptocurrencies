# Crypto Currencies

## Overview

This project is to analyse various cryptocurrencies data (from CryptoCompare) using unsupervised machine learning to gain insights into the data. 
The data is loaded into a pandas dataframe and is preprocessed using various pandas functions. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm, is then used to reduce the dimensions of the dataset. Elbowcurve and KMeans algorithm are then used to group the data into different clusters. Finally the data is vizualised using 3D and 2D Plots and tables.
